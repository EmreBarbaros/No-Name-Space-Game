There is danger ahead. But do not be afraid\
For I am with you, like breath itself\
Darkness will lead to light. Colour will bleed\
Into the night. Beautiful colours, the like of which you have never\
Seen. Let the dream of confusion lead you into the virgin light!\
Be gone! Be all seeing, be brave!\
